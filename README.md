#A Guide to the Design Sprint

Learn early, learn often. Design matters. Speed matters. You either win or you learn.

The idea of the Design Sprint is simple: shortcut the entire Lean UX Process by building a prototype so that you can figure out the strategy for your project.

GV has used this method for 100+ startups, helping them realize their maximum potential. With this method you either build something awesome, or you learn from your mistakes; both are super valuable.

The art of the Design Sprint is creating, capturing, and channeling the energy and passion for a product or service in your design team. You want to build a solid, energetic jumping off point for the project as a whole, and create enough initial energy to make it through the entire project.

##Design Sprint: Boiled Down

The Design Sprint covers 5 steps, and is usually conducted in 5 days:

- Understand (or INSPIRATION) — What are the user needs, business need and technology capacities? (Desirability, Viability, Feasibility)
- Diverge (or IDEATION) — How might we explore as many ideas as possible?
- Converge — Select the best ideas so far.
- Prototype (or IMPLEMENTATION) — Create artifacts that allows you to test the ideas with users.
- Validate — Test the ideas with users, business stakeholders and technical experts.

Keep these things to keep in mind with your Design Sprint:

- Create artificial time pressure (this is where the magic comes from)
- Get into a prototype mindset
- Do not be afraid to do quick research
- Prepare well, it makes the sprint energetic and enjoyable
- Make sure the executives are included in the Understand and Converge phases
